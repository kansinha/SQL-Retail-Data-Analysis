This project is based on the course “Complete Your First Project in SQL” by Megan Silvey and focuses on building foundational SQL skills through hands-on retail data analysis. The goal is to extract actionable insights from a sales database and demonstrate practical use of SQL for data management, cleaning, and reporting.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data — including information about products, customers, and orders — to identify trends and improve data quality. This involves:

Updating and inserting new records in relevant tables

Identifying and correcting data inconsistencies

Analyzing customer behavior and sales performance across time

The dataset used in this project includes:

Product data: containing details such as product ID, name, size, and category

Order and order item records: tracking transactions, quantities, and pricing

Customer data: including unique customer IDs and order history

Inserting new customer and product records using INSERT INTO

Updating missing values and cleaning data using UPDATE, IS NULL, and conditional logic

Identifying duplicate or missing entries using GROUP BY, HAVING, and filtering

Using JOINs to combine multiple tables for holistic analysis

Calculating sales performance by month and year using MONTHNAME() and YEAR()

Finding top-selling products and highest-spending customers using aggregation

Computing repeat customer rates to evaluate customer loyalty
